# WEEK 1 QUIZ
## Q1. The output of a logistic regression model applied to a data sample _____________.
    is the probability of the sample being in a certain class. 

## Q2. Describe how any binary classification model can be extended from its basic form on two classes, to work on multiple classes.

    Use a one-versus all technique, where for each class you fit a binary classifier to that class versus all of the other classes. 

## Q3. Which tool is most appropriate for measuring the performance of a classifier on unbalanced classes?

    The precision-recall curve.

## Q4. (True/False) One of the requirements of logistic regression is that you need a variable with two classes.
    False


## Q5. (True/False) The shape of ROC curves are the leading indicator of an overfitted logistic regression.
    False

## Q6. Consider this scenario for Questions 3 to 7.

## You are evaluating a binary classifier. There are 50 positive outcomes in the test data, and 100 observations. Using a 50% threshold, the classifier predicts 40 positive outcomes, of which 10 are incorrect.

## What is the classifier’s Precision on the test sample?

    75%


## Q7. Consider this scenario for Questions 3 to 7.

## You are evaluating a binary classifier. There are 50 positive outcomes in the test data, and 100 observations. Using a 50% threshold, the classifier predicts 40 positive outcomes, of which 10 are incorrect.

## What is the classifier’s Recall on the test sample?

    60%


## Q8. Consider this scenario for Questions 3 to 7.
## You  are evaluating a binary classifier. There are 50 positive outcomes in  the test data, and 100 observations. Using a 50% threshold, the  classifier predicts 40 positive outcomes, of which 10 are incorrect.
## What is the classifier’s F1 score on the test sample?
    66.7%

## Q9. Consider this scenario for Questions 3 to 7.

## You  are evaluating a binary classifier. There are 50 positive outcomes in  the test data, and 100 observations. Using a 50% threshold, the  classifier predicts 40 positive outcomes, of which 10 are incorrect.

## Increasing the threshold to 60% results in 5 additional positive predictions, all of which are correct. Which of the following statements about this new model (compared with the original model that had a 50% threshold) is TRUE?

    The area under the ROC curve would remain the same. 

## Q10. Consider this scenario for Questions 3 to 7.

## You  are evaluating a binary classifier. There are 50 positive outcomes in  the test data, and 100 observations. Using a 50% threshold, the  classifier predicts 40 positive outcomes, of which 10 are incorrect.

## The threshold is now increased further, to 70%. Which of the following statements is TRUE?
    The Precision of the classifier would increase or remain the same.
